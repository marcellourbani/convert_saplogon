# Convert saplogon

A small utility to convert SAP xml connection files to saplogon.ini format

Just feed it the source and destination file:

```bash
convert_saplogon SAPGUILandscape.xml saplogon.ini
```

## Disclaimer

I wrote this because I needed to convert one file and couldn't find a converter online.
I only tested it on a couple of files
